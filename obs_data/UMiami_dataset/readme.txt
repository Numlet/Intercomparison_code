These are both SEAREX stations. It is a little confusing because some
stations go by different names/codes. Cheju is the station in Korea which
later became Kosan. Tutulia is the NOAA station on American Samoa.

Re the source of the data, you can simply state personal communication.
Eventually they will be posted on a web site. the problem at the moment is
that I have no grad student/post doc who can handle all this.
