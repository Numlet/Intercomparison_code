Notes: PM2.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Azores (AZO) (38°41′N, 27°21′W) sampling was done at top of a 50 m high cliff over the sea, west of the Terceira Island (397 km2, 60,000 inhabitants). The site area is used for cattle grazing and horticulture. The Azores are in the mid-north Atlantic Ocean, representative of background marine atmosphere, with levels frequently influenced by transport from North America and, to a lesser degree, from Europe and Africa. Aerosol was sampled by sucking air at a flow rate of 1.1 m3 min−1 through quartz fiber filters (Whatman QM-A, 10 × 8 inches). The sampler stands 2.5 m above the ground and was run with an Anderson PM10 inlet to remove particles larger than 10 μm. The filter holder had a Tisch 2.5 μm impactor stage which separates particles larger and smaller than 2.5 μm. Only PM2.5 particles were analyzed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
